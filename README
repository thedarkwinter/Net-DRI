Net::DRI
========

A Perl library to access Domain Name Registries/Registrars:
DRI stands for Domain Registration Interface and aims to be,
for domain name registries/registrars/resellers
what Perl DBI is for databases.

Net::DRI offers a uniform API to access services.
It can be used by registries to test their systems.
It can be used by registrars to access registries.
It can be used by clients to access registrars and/or resellers.
It can be used by anonyone to do whois, DAS or IRIS DCHK queries.

It is an OO framework that can be easily extended to
handle various protocols (RRP, EPP, custom protocols) and
various transports methods (TCP, TLS, SOAP, email, etc...).

Specific policies for each registry are handled in a Net::DRI::DRD
subclass, DRD standing for Domain Registry Driver with registry
being used broadly to describe a service offering domain names
and related things, which can be provided by a true domain name
registry, a registrar or a reseller at any level in the chain.

Net::DRI standardizes as much as possible on EPP which is the current
standard for domain name activities, for example for status codes.

Net::DRI has been used to help conduct IETF interoperability tests, and is used
in production by various organizations with success. It follows Perl Best Practices level 4 policies.

Currently Net::DRI ships with:

- a full RRP implementation (RFC 2832 & 3632)
- a full EPP implementation (STD 69 aka RFC 5730/5731/5732/5733/5734/3735), including registry notifications
- many EPP extensions:
  * GracePeriod (RFC 3915)
  * E164 for ENUM (RFC 4114)
  * Enum Validation (RFC 5076)
  * SecDNS for DNSSEC in EPP, both version 1.0 (RFC 4310) and version 1.1 (RFC 5910)
  * Infrastructure ENUM in Austria
  * NSgroup and Keygroup (used by .BE and .EU)
  * VeriSign extensions: Sync, WhoisInfo, WhoWas, PremiumDomain, Suggestion, ClientAttributes, Balance
  * IDN extension (draft-obispo-epp-idn-02)
  * KeyRelay extension (draft-gieben-epp-keyrelay-02)
  * AusRegistry extensions: KeyValue, IDN, Variant
  * CentralNic extensions: Release, TTL, WebForwarding, Pricing
  * CloudRegistry extension: LaunchPhase
  * CoCCA extension: IPVerification
  * ICANN extension: MarkSignedMark (SMD for TMCH in new gTLDs)
  * Domain/Contact/Host and other extensions needed for extra services in various TLD:

- Net::DRI::DRD::* modules to use registrars API for Gandi, OVH, BookMyName, OpenSRS
- Net::DRI::DRD::ISPAPI : the ISPAPI Registry driver for Net::DRI enables you to connect HEXONET's
  EPP server and gives you the possibility to manage a wide range of gTLDs
  and ccTLDs.
  In addition to the EPP 1.0 compliant commands there is a Key-Value mapping
  for additional domain related parameters which are required by several
  registries.
  The driver also supports all other HEXONET commands like queries for
  domain and contact lists. It is also possible to access additional HEXONET
  products like virtual servers and ssl certificates.

If you are a registry/registrar/reseller, we would welcome
the opportunity to be able to test Net::DRI against your system. Please
drop a note to the authors of Net::DRI and do not hesitate to provide
this framework to your clients (see license file).

If you are already using Net::DRI or planning to do so, please let us also know.
Do not hesitate to let others know and if you want, you are welcome to make a link
back to our website at <http://www.dotandco.com/services/software/Net-DRI/index.en>

If you find this software useful, we would welcome any kind of support to continue working on it.

How to use
----------

As a binary, a script called drish is installed, and is a wrapper
around the Net::DRI shell, see its documentation inside Net::DRI::Shell

You can find examples in the eg subdirectory:

afnic_email.pl : as AFNIC member, to use the email robot
ws_rrp.pl    : as registrar, to connect to .WS using RRP
eurid_epp.pl : as registrar, connect to EURid test systems
cat_epp.pl   : as registrar, connect to .CAT test systems
coop_epp.pl  : as registrar, connect to .COOP test systems
ispapi_epp.pl: as registrar, connect to Hexonet systems
epp_client_no.pl (+ xmlfilter.pl) : as registrar, do operations with the .NO registry
epp_client_se.pl : as registrar, do operations with the .SE registry
das.pl       : for anyone, to check domain availability in various TLDs
whois.pl     : for anyone, to do whois queries for some TLDs.
iris_dchk.pl : for anyone, to do IRIS DCHK queries for some .DE domain names

In the t subdirectory, the test files can also be studied for insight
of all the API available.

All errors trigger an exception using die and a specific class
(Net::DRI::Exception). Thus all calls to Net::DRI methods should be
put in an eval() to easily trap exceptions. Please see Net::DRI::Exception
for details about information available when an exception is raised.

Net::DRI uses an internal cache (in the future many different backends will
be available for this service), and you can provide the global time to live of objects
in it when you create the Net::DRI object. A negative ttl means no cache at all.
It is recommended not to completely disable the cache, and to have a ttl of at
least of few seconds: it will cut down the use of checks and related verifications
done at registry, especially for complex operations.

Typical use of this library would be like the following
(but please not that parts of this documentation may be outdated,
and you should double check inside the Changes file as well as the examples
described above and the test files):

- $dri=Net::DRI->new(...) to create the global object. Save the result,
  everything will be done with methods applied on this object.
  You can choose the logging you wish (among base modules provided: no logging
  at all, all logging to STDERR and logging into files, one per registry+profile)
  and the cache time to live. See Net::DRI module documentation for more information
  on caching and logging.

- $dri->add_registry(...) to add a new registry driver
  First argument is the registry class name (Net::DRI::DRD:: will be added if no :: is found),
  second argument is an hash ref setting information : you should have at least
  a client_id key whose value is the client identifier at this registry for the client connecting
  (this is needed for the various _is_mine() methods - see below)

  You can attach as many registry drivers as you need to a single Net::DRI object
  this would enable you to easily operate on multiple registries at the same time
  Use $dri->target('registry name') to set the current registry, the one which
  will receive all future calls.
  The target method returns the $dri object, thus can be chained with other calls.
  Besides the registry name you can also pass a domain name or a TLD, and the library
  will try to find the correct registry. This will work only if you have no overlap between
  your TLDs among various registries

- $dri->add_profile('profilename','profiletype',{transport params},{protocol params})
 (or add_current_profile with same parameters as in add_profile and it will also
   set the default profile to the one being created)
  to use registry driver default for profiletype (see transport_protocol_default in each DRD modules)
  for transport & protocol classes.

  Each registry driver is used through a specific profile. Each driver can have at the same time
  as many profiles as needed.
  A profile is:
  - a name
  - a transport, with specific parameters
  - a protocol, with specific parameters

  This enables you to be connected to the same registries with different credentials at the same
  time, or through different transports, if the registry provides for example access by email
  and by TCP at the same time.

  You switch profile using the $dri->target('registry name','profile name') call.

  add_profile() and add_current_profile() return a Net::DRI::Protocol::ResultStatus
  in all cases, and this should be tested with ->is_success() to be sure the profile
  has been created correctly.
  They may also die for some other internal errors.

  Optionnally, you can use an auto target function:
  by providing details about which profile to use for each given action,
  Net::DRI can switch to the profile needed automatically, thus you will not need
  anymore to call target() by yourself.
  To do that, you will need to provide information by calling:
  $dri->set_auto_target('profile','type','action')
  Profile is the profile name to use when doing
  action 'action' (check, info, create, etc...) on object type 'type' (domain, host, contact).
  The profile must exist before calling set_auto_target()
  A default profile can be specified when type and/or action is undef.

- after registries and profiles have been created (others can be added at any time),
 you can apply many methods (see below) to the $dri object
 You can change the current registry and/or current profile at any time using $dri->target(X,Y)

 You get back for most of the calls an object representing the status.
 It is an instance of Net::DRI::Protocol::ResultStatus, please see its documentation.
 Through it you can access all details about the operation that has been done, including
 raw data, using the get_data() and get_data_collection() methods (see module documentation).
 As long as you keep the object, the data is there, and will not be deleted, while data
 in cache (and accessed through $dri->get_info()) will be deleted after its time to live
 has elapsed.

 You can also always use the following methods:
 result_is_success()
 result_code()
 result_native_code()
 result_message()
 result_lang()
 result_is_pending()
 result_trid()
 to get back the same information (if not given by the methods or if you want to discard output)

 Information that has been sent by registry will also be available through $dri->get_info(...)
 with a specific key. The key to use depends on the operation, but should be mostly registry-independent.
 get_info() gives back information related to the latest operation.
 If you use target() and later get_info() you will get information related to the latest operation
 for the registry/profile specified in the target() call.

 See below the list of methods you can call, and information available after each in get_info()

- when you are finished, call $dri->end() to deallocate ressources and close any open connections.


If using the Socket transport, you can make sure the connection is still open by using the
ping() method, such as : $dri->transport()->ping()
It will return 1 if the connection is still there, 0 otherwise.
If you pass a true value to ping(), it will automatically reconnect if the connection is broken.

Available API
-------------

Please see the included tests (directory t/) and examples (directory eg/) for many
examples of use and full API coverage.

* has_object($type)

 gives 1 if the registry manages objects of type $type (domain, ns, contact, etc...)

* periods()

 gives the list of all registration periods allowed by the current registry.
 Periods are given as DateTime::Duration objects.

* is_my_tld()

 with a domain name as argument, returns 1 if the current registry handles this
 domain name (TLD of domain name is handled by registry)

* cache_clear()

 completely delete cache for current registry and current profile

* verify_name_domain() verify_name_host()

 gives 0 if the given argument is a correct name for a domain name or an hostname
 at the current registry.

* verify_duration_create() verify_duration_renew() verify_duration_transfer()

 called internally at various stages in Net::DRI to verify that we can add/renew/transfer
 a domain name

* domain_create()

 Create a domain name and associated operations (except if pure creation is asked)
 at the current registry and current profile. A domain name and an hash ref should be provided.
 The hash ref can have a "duration" key with its value being a DateTime::Duration object,
 and a "ns" key with its value being a Net::DRI::Data::Hosts object.

 The following operations are done (if pure creation is asked, only step 4 is done):

 0) we do a domain_check operation and stop if the domain exists already
 1) we separate nameservers : those being inside domain name being created, those being outside
 2) we test outside nameservers for existence at registry, and if it fails, we try to create them
 3) we create all needed contacts, for thick registries
 4) we create domain
 5) we create nameservers that are inside domain (in-bailiwick nameservers)
 6) we update domain to add nameservers created at step 5.
 7) if a status key exists in hash ref given, we try to change status of newly created domain name

 You get back a ResultStatus that may contain all results chained, see this module documentation.

 You may use get_info with the following keys to get more information:
 - exDate : for the current expiration date (a DateTime object)
 - status : for the current status of domain name

* domain_delete()

 Delete a domain and associated opeations (except if a pure deletion is askedt)
 at the current registry and current profile.
 A domain name should be provided.

 The following operations are done (if pure delete is asked, only step 3 is done):

 1) we find the current list of nameservers for this domain
 2) we remove all nameservers from this domain
 3) we delete the domain name
 (which can fail if some nameservers use the domain name in their FQDN,
 we should try to rename them first, it is planned for later)

 See domain_create() for information on what you get back.

* domain_info()

 Ask for all information on a given domain name at the current registry and current profile.
 A second optional parameter is an hash ref. It can include an auth key, for EPP registries for example.

 You may use get_info or ResultStatus::get_data with the following keys to get more information:
 - ns : a Net::DRI::Data::Hosts object representing the nameservers of the domain
 - status : a Net::DRI::Data::StatusList object representing the current status list of the domain queried
 - exDate, crDate, upDate, trDate : DateTime objects representing the expiration, creation, last update, and
                          transfer date for the domain queried
 - clID, crID, upID : (strings) local registry ID of the current sponsoring registrar, the registrar having created,
                       and the registrar (or registry) having last modified the domain queried

* domain_check()

 Check if a domain name exists or not at the current registry and current profile.

 $dri->get_info('exist') returns 0 or 1

 When given a list of domain names, will check for each one, using one or more registry
 calls depending on the registry and protocol selected.

 $dri->get_info('exist','domain',$domain) returns 0 or 1 for the given domain name in $domain
 (the cache ttl must be positive and large enough (few seconds) for that to work) ;
 you can also use $rc->get_data('domain',$domain,'exist') - please note the different API -
 which will always have data, independently from cache.

* domain_exist()

 Same as previous, but we get back 0 or 1 if the domain does not exist/exist or undef if we do not know.

* domain_update()

 Update the domain name given as argument at the current registry and current profile.
 Most of the time you should use the following more specific methods.

* domain_update_ns()

 Update nameservers of the domain name given as argument at the current registry and current profile.
 Most of the time you should use the following more specific methods.

* domain_update_ns_add()

 For the given domain name as first argument,
 add the nameservers given as second argument (being a Net::DRI::Data::Hosts object).

* domain_update_ns_del()

 Same as previous to delete nameservers

* domain_update_ns_set()

 Same as previous to set the current list of nameservers, irrespective to what they are now.

* domain_update_status()

 Update statuses of the domain name given as argument at the current registry and current profile.
 Most of the time you should use the following more specific methods.

* domain_update_status_add()

 For the given domain name as first argument, add the statuses given as second argument.

 To create the second argument, call $dri->local_object('status')->no()
 with up to three parameters :
 - first one is a string among renew, update, transfer, publish, delete (choices depending on the registry),
   which sets what is forbidden,
 - second (optional) one is a message (ex: Payment overdue),
 - third (optional, default to 'en') is the language of the previous message.

 The call to local_object('status') creates a new object from a class which is a subclass of Net::DRI::Data::StatusList,
 that can be used in all functions related to statuses.

* domain_update_status_del()

 Same as previous to delete statuses.

* domain_update_status_set()

 Same as previous to set the current list of status, irrespective to what they are now.

* domain_update_contact()

 Update contacts of the domain name given as argument at the current registry and current profile.
 Most of the time you should use the following more specific methods.

* domain_update_contact_add()

 For the given domain name as first argument, add the contacts given as second argument which is a
 Net::DRI::Data::ContactSet instance.

* domain_update_contact_del()

 Same as previous to delete contacts.

* domain_update_contact_set()

 Same as previous to set the current list of contacts, irrespective to what they are now.

* domain_renew()

 Renew the domain name provided as first argument,
 with optionnally a ref hash, with keys duration and current_expiration.

 You may use get_info() to retrieve the same information as after domain_create()

* domain_transfer()

 Various operations related to transfers of domain names.
 Most of the time you should use the following more specific methods.

* domain_transfer_start()

 Start the transfer of the given domain name as first argument.
 A second optional argument is an hash ref that can include for example an auth key for authorization information.

* domain_transfer_stop()

 Stop the transfer of the given domain name as first argument (used by the registrar having started the transfer).
 A second optional argument is an hash ref that can include for example an auth key for authorization information.

* domain_transfer_query()

 Query the state of the ongoing transfer for the given domain name as first argument.
 A second optional argument is an hash ref that can include for example an auth key for authorization information.

 A second optional argument is an hash ref that can include for example an auth key for authorization information.

* domain_transfer_refuse()

 Refuse the transfer of the given domain name as first argument (used by the registrar currently sponsoring the domain name).
 A second optional argument is an hash ref that can include for example an auth key for authorization information.

* domain_can()

 For the domain name given as first argument, and for the operation given as second
 (being either 'renew','update','delete' or 'tranfer'), returns 1 if we can
 do the requested operation at the current registry and current profile.
 We check the domain name status, and if possible who sponsors currently the domain name,
 and if the action requested needs sponsorship.

* domain_status_allows()

 Check if the current status of the domain name given as first argument allows
 for a specific operation.
 Most of the time you should use the following more specific methods.

 Else, 0.

* domain_status_allows_update()

 Same for update.

* domain_status_allows_renew()

 Same for renew.

* domain_status_allows_transfer()

* domain_is_mine()

 Returns 1 if we are the current sponsor of the domain name given as first argument 
 at the current registry and current profile.
 Else, 0.

* host_create()

 Create a new nameserver. The first argument should be a Net::DRI::Data::Hosts object.
 Some registries may require or permit a second argument, used in the same way as in domain_create()
